# JobAnalytics

Final Year Project.

Job Analytics is a web application for employers and applicants to post and find jobs. Employers
can post jobs on the app and applicants can apply for open positions. When an employer gets a
CV from an applicant, the application will examine an applicantâ€™s CV and return how qualified that
person is for the specific role and will also predict how hard that person will work. The idea
behind this is to make recruiting for an open vacancy easier by letting the application do all the
work for the employer. All the application needs is a CV. The application will provide the
employer with some statistics about their pool of applicants that have applied for their job
postings. Job Analytics is built using the Django web framework and uses a Random Forest
classifier to predict applicant work ethic.
