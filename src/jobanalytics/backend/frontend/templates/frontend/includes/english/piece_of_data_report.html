<p>We wanted to figure if this had a direct influence on an employee’s decision to leave. After all,
once you hire someone you want them to stay and this means doing your best to keep them happy and performing well in their role! </p>
<p><img src="{% static 'frontend/images/evaluation_vs_leaving_KDEplot.png' %}" style="float: right;">A Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plot was used to represent if an employee’s evaluation rate has a direct impact on an
employee leaving. We learned that employees with a low evaluation (<0.6) and a high evaluation (>0.8) are more likely to leave. Employees
between these values are less likely to leave abruptly.</p>
<p>So we learned that employees with certain evaluation rates are more likely to leave. We wanted to see what other attributes affect an employee evaluation.</p>
